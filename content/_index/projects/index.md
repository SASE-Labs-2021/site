In the past, projects have included a smart water bottle and [an app to navigate the Gopher Way tunnels](https://SASE-Labs-2020.github.io/gopher-tunneler). The project is decided by the members while the coordinators provide the resources and support to finish it. Last year, we were able to launch our app despite the fact that none of our members knew JavaScript or React prior to the project.
